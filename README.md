Provides a platform-agnostic, no_std-compatible driver for the ST LSM6DSV16X IMU, supporting both I2C and SPI communication interfaces.

## Sensor Overview

The LSM6DSV16X is a high-performance, low-power 6-axis small IMU, featuring a 3-axis digital accelerometer and a 3-axis digital gyroscope, that offers the best IMU sensor with a triple-channel architecture for processing acceleration and angular rate data on three separate channels (user interface, OIS, and EIS) with dedicated configuration, processing, and filtering.

The LSM6DSV16X enables processes in edge computing, leveraging embedded advanced dedicated features such as a finite state machine (FSM) for configurable motion tracking and a machine learning core (MLC) for context awareness with exportable AI features for IoT applications.

The LSM6DSV16X supports the adaptive self-configuration (ASC) feature, which allows the FSM to automatically reconfigure the device in real time based on the detection of a specific motion pattern or based on the output of a specific decision tree configured in the MLC, without any intervention from the host processor.

The LSM6DSV16X embeds Qvar (electric charge variation detection) for user interface functions like tap, double tap, triple tap, long press, or L/R â€“ R/L swipe.

The LSM6DSV16X embeds an analog hub able to connect an external analog input and convert it to a digital signal for processing.

## Installation

Add the driver to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
lsm6dsv16x-rs = "0.1.0"
```

Or, add it directly from the terminal:

```sh
cargo add lsm6dsv16x-rs
```

## Usage

Include the crate and its prelude
```rust
use lsm6dsv16x_rs as lsm6dsv16x;
use lsm6dsv16x::*;
use lsm6dsv16x::prelude::*;
```

### Create an instance

Create an instance of the driver with the `new_<bus>` associated function, by passing an I2C (`embedded_hal::i2c::I2c`) instance and I2C address, or an SPI (`embedded_hal::spi::SpiDevice`) instance, along with a timing peripheral.

An example with I2C:

```rust
let mut sensor = Lsm6dsv16x::new_i2c(i2c, I2CAddress::I2cAddH, delay);
```

### Check "Who Am I" Register

This step ensures correct communication with the sensor. It returns a unique ID to verify the sensor's identity.

```rust
let whoami = sensor.device_id_get().unwrap();
if whoami != ID {
    panic!("Invalid sensor ID");
}
```

### Configure

See details in specific examples; the following are common api calls:

```rust
// Restore default configuration
sensor.reset_set(Reset::RestoreCtrlRegs).unwrap();
let mut rst: Reset = Reset::RestoreCtrlRegs;
while rst != Reset::Ready {
    rst = sensor.reset_get().unwrap();
}

// Enable Block Data Update
sensor.block_data_update_set(1).unwrap();

// Set Output Data Rate for accelerometer and gyroscope
sensor.xl_data_rate_set(Odr::_7_5hz).unwrap();
sensor.gy_data_rate_set(Odr::_15hz).unwrap();

// Set full scale for accelerometer and gyroscope
sensor.xl_full_scale_set(XlFullScale::_2g).unwrap();
sensor.gy_full_scale_set(GyFullScale::_2000dps).unwrap();
```
