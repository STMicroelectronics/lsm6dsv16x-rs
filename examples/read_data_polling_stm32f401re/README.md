# LSM6DSV16X Accelerometer and Temperature Data Acquisition on STM32F401RE Nucleo-64

This example demonstrates how to read acceleration and temperature data from the **LSM6DSV16X** sensor using an **STM32F401RE** microcontroller board. The sensor is configured to operate in polling mode without interrupts, and the program outputs sensor readings over UART.

## Hardware Setup

- **Microcontroller Board:** STM32F401RE Nucleo-64
- **Sensor:** LSM6DSV16X Accelerometer
- **Communication Interface:** I2C1 at 100 kHz Standard Mode
- **UART:** USART2 for serial output at 115200 baud

### Default Pin Configuration

| Signal       | STM32F401RE Pin | Description                    |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| I2C1_SCL     | PB8             | I2C clock line (open-drain)   |
| I2C1_SDA     | PB9             | I2C data line (open-drain)    |
| USART2_TX    | PA2             | UART transmit for debug output|

The LSM6DSV16X sensor is connected to the STM32F401RE via I2C1 on pins PB8 (SCL) and PB9 (SDA). UART output is routed through PA2.

## Code Description

### Initialization

- The program initializes microcontroller peripherals including clocks, GPIO pins, I2C, UART, and a delay abstraction.
- I2C1 is configured at 100 kHz Standard Mode on pins PB8 (SCL) and PB9 (SDA).
- UART is configured on USART2 (PA2) at 115200 baud for serial output.

### Sensor Configuration

- The LSM6DSV16X sensor is initialized over I2C with the high I2C address.
- The sensor is taken out of deep power down mode.
- The device ID is read and verified; if mismatched, the program halts.
- The sensor is reset to default configuration and waits until reset completes.
- Block Data Update (BDU) and interface increment (IF_INC) are enabled for safe driver usage.
- Output data rate is set to 25 Hz with Â±4g full scale and low-pass filter.

### Data Acquisition Loop

- The program continuously polls the sensor for new acceleration data availability.
- When new data is ready, acceleration and temperature data are read.
- Sensor readings are printed over UART every second.

## Usage

1. Connect the LSM6DSV16X sensor to the STM32F401RE Nucleo board via I2C1 (PB8/PB9).
2. Build and flash the firmware onto the STM32F401RE board.
3. Open a serial terminal at 115200 baud on the USART2 TX line.
4. Observe acceleration and temperature readings printed every second.

## Notes

- This example uses polling mode without interrupts.
- UART output uses blocking writes.
- The environment is `#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]` for embedded Rust applications.
- Panic behavior is set to halt on panic using `panic_halt`.
